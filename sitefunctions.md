- Pomodoros timer access
- Custom timer access

Both should have their own seperate 'blocks' in a modular append system.

### Pomodoro timer (tools/pomodoro/index.html)

- There should be a pomodoros timer with sound. 
- There should also be a skip timer to directly skip to the break, alongside a start timer button and a reset button. Also a pause button. Each button should be styled and have a hover property.

### Custom timer (tools/custom-timer/index.html)

- There should be a modular customizable timer with 'segments'.
- The segments, timeline, and buttons should all be aesthetically pleasing and formatted in a logical, easy to use way.
1. The user should be able to create a segment. The segment will have a label/name, and the duration. 
2. The user's segment will be added to a timeline/list. the timeline should be viewable and aesthetically pleasing.
3. The user should be able to add a 'loop clause' at any given point. no segments can be added after a loop segment.
4. The user must have controls to pause, reset, and start the timer as well as a skip button to move to the next segment if necessary. 
5. Each time a segment ends a sound should play.
